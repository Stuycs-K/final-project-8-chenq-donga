## Overview
This is a tower defense game, where you place towers to defend against enemies. As of the demo, enemies do not spawn in naturally, but that will be fixed for the main presentation. Towers have a set range in which they will attack enemes, and do a set amount of damage.


## Instructions
As of demo:
 - left click to place a tower, which will cost money and can't be placed on path squares(brown color).
 - right click to summon a enemy at the location of the mouse.
 	- currently set to 3 hp
 	- killing the enemy will give back money.
 - spacebar to trigger spawning of impossible enemy(mini k's).
 - if enough enemies reach the end, the game is over. Press spacebar to restart.
